# HighlightBot_v1.5

Simple bot that scan several subreddits using Reddit's API, selects highlight posts, goes to their sources and downloads them into sorted folders within a daily folder on your desktop. 

Born out of wanting to see daily or nightly highlights of my favorite sports without having to wade through endless commercials or memes.

Will not work on other machines without creating creds.py in HighlotBot_Main and adding a streamables.com username and password for API access, also you will need to edit the directories in highlight_bot where notated.
