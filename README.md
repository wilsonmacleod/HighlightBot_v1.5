# HighlightBot_v1.5

Simple bot that scan several subreddits using Reddit's API, selects highlight posts, goes to their sources and downloads them into sorted folders within a daily folder on your desktop. 

Born out of wanting to see daily or nightly highlights of my favorite sports without having to wade through endless commercials or memes.
